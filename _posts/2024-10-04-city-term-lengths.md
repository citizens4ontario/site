### As I have said before I am just a person doing this on my own time

I might have missed a city near by that has a Council or Mayor with longer term lengths, but from my research here, Ontario wins by a bit.

### This is not inherently a bad thing

If there are not problems with your city, then this is not an issue at all. If you aren't a fan of how your city is run, then maybe it is ü§∑‚Äç.

### Articles have been written about other city's term lengths, but not Ontario?

The [San Bernardino County Sentinel](sncsentinel.com) even wrote an entire article [making it sound like Chino Hills was some sort of Mafia](https://sbcsentinel.com/2024/02/c-h-council-to-discuss-term-limits/).
They even used the phase "Cosa Nostra" in comparison, which I even think is kind of harsh. Chino Hills average term length is 13 compared to Ontario's 20.75.

### Some notes on the data
 - Claremont and Chino Hills do this thing where they rotate the Mayor title every year, so I added up to total amount of time their current Mayor has spent as Mayor. I honestly think this is a cool idea, and had no idea this was a thing before doing this research.
 - Some of these numbers were tough to track down, or I had to round +/- a year since the exact start dates were tough to find. Overall I think these numbers are close enough for the comparison that I am making here.
 - The current Mayors of Chino and Montclair server pretty long terms as Council members before becoming Mayors. Even with these included it would not have swayed the averages too much.
   - Eunice Ulloa of Chino served for 14 years as a City Council Member before Becoming mayor.
   - Javier Dutrey of Montclair served for 22 years as a City Council Member before Becoming mayor.

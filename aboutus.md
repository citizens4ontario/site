---

## What is our goal?

Our goal is to keep Ontario citizens informed about what is happening in their city. We want to provide a single source of information that is easy to access and easy to understand.

## Why are we doing this?

We believe the City of Ontario should be transparent and accountable to its citizens.

## What is this?

- This is an ongoing project, and will not have everything you want, but we want to provide as much as we can, and as simply as we can.
- This is meant to be a purely factual source of information. If you find something that is false, please let us know, and site what sources you can.
- This is **NOT** a political platform, and we have no political affiliations.
- This is **NOT** a platform for opinions. We are not interested in opinions, only facts.
- As you can tell this is not meant to be pretty, but functional. We are not designers, we are citizens.

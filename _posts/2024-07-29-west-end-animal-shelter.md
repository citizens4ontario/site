  - Chino and Ontario will build a new $50 million animal services facility at Riverside Dr. and Campus
  - Ontario will pay for 65% of the costs, and have 2/3 of the board member seats
  - Annual costs of the new facility are estimated to be ~$6.6 million per year once the new facility is up and running
  - The new facility will be called West End Animal Services Agency
  - The new facility will include a public dog park
  - The IVHS location is in Pomona, so this would be closer to Ontario residents
  - Costs could be lower if more cities or entities join in the project
  - Both cities seem to agree that IVHS has not been able to keep up with their demand

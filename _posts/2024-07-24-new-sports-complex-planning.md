The conceptual plan for the sports facility.
I do not think this is not set in stone, but likely close to what it will look like.

It says "tennis pickleball courts", but I am not sure if they are full size tennis courts.

The borders will be Vineyard Ave to the West, Riverside Dr to the North, Wash Basin/KB Homes to the East, and Chino Ave to the South
